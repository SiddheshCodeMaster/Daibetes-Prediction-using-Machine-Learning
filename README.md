I am applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier. 

### So, what is SVM?
- It is one of the most important algorithms which comes under Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms (We are implicitly feeding the data to the ML Algorithm and the Algorithm learns from the data itself).

- SVM, once fed with data, it tries to create a graph and tries to calculate the hyperplane. The hyperplane seperates the types of data (basically labels).

- In my project case, SVM will create a hyperplane for two types of class labels: 
    - Diabetic Patient
    - Non-Diabetic Patient

### Workflow:

Diabetes Data ---> Data Preprocessing ---> Train Test Split ---> SVM Classifier

New Data ---> SVM Classifier ---> Diabetic or Non-Diabetic Patient
